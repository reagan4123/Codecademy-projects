# Codecademy Project
The objective of this project was to practice using flexbox. It took me a bit to trouble shoot some of the issues I encountered, however I was able to get it figured out and enjoyed this project. I do think that I could be making my HTML and CSS coding cleaner and more efficient. If you take a peak at the files and have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out.
